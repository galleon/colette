## Diagnosing Incorrect Answers

Colette may occasionally return incorrect answers. Follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify retrieval of correct source documents.**

   * If the correct answer **is not** present in any retrieved document, the failure is in retrieval. To fix:

     1. Confirm that the relevant documents are included in your corpus.
     2. Create a separate RAG index containing only those documents.
     3. Query this index:

        * If the correct answer appears, but was missing in the full corpus, improve your retrieval model (e.g., use a larger or different embedding model).
        * If the correct answer still fails to appear, refine your indexing model.
   * If the correct answer **is** present in the retrieved documents, proceed to step 2.

2. **Assess the inference LLM.**

   * If relevant sources are retrieved but the generated answer is wrong, the inference LLM likely underperforms. Try a larger or alternative LLM.

3. **Escalate if unresolved.**

   * If the issue persists after improving retrieval and inference, [report the problem](#reporting-issues) with a non-confidential example for further investigation.

## Reporting Issues

If you can't resolve a problem:

1. Check existing issues for similar reports on GitHub: [https://github.com/jolibrain/colette/issues](https://github.com/jolibrain/colette/issues).
2. If none match, create a new issue including:

   * Description of the failure.
   * Example input and output.
   * Relevant logs or environment details.
   * Non-confidential document illustrating the error.

## Installation and Runtime Errors

For errors during installation or execution:

1. Review the known issues list.
2. If missing, submit a new issue with:

   * Installation steps and environment (OS, Python version, etc.).
   * Full error logs and stack traces.
